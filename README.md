shes best friends with choco...was one of the people that actually blamed icey for choco's death.

ill update her lore later its almost 3 am..


OK, HERES THE UPDATE!!!!

nickname; Berri

"shes best friends with choco...was one of the people that actually blamed icey for choco's death" and held a grudge against icey.

extra; icey tried apologizing to berri in any type of way he could think of but still couldnt get forgiven.

extra 2; berri was also friends with icey but cut contact with him after choco's death.

extra lore for both of those 3; they were orphans so they didnt get to see their parents' faces. got abandoned and sent straight to an orphanage when they were born.

im thinking about adding the caregiver.
